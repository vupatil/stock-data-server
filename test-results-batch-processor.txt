=== BATCH PROCESSOR TEST SUMMARY ===

Test File: test-batch-processor.js
Command: npm run test:processor

RESULTS:
 21/21 tests passed (100%)

TEST CATEGORIES:
1. Unit Tests - splitIntoBatches() - 6/6 passed
2. Unit Tests - processBatchedSymbols() - 5/5 passed
3. Unit Tests - Error Handling - 3/3 passed
4. Unit Tests - Configuration Options - 4/4 passed
5. Integration Tests - Alpaca API - 3/3 passed
6. Integration Tests - Database - 1/1 passed
7. Performance Benchmarks - 1/1 passed

KEY FINDINGS:
 Batch processor correctly splits symbols into batches of 50
 Handles edge cases (empty, single, exact 50, 51, 150 symbols)
 Error handling works correctly (partial failure, stop on error)
 Configuration options work as expected
 Alpaca API integration successful (small, medium, large batches)
 Database integration successful
 Performance: 74.6% faster than sequential processing

VALIDATION:
 ALPACA_BATCH_SIZE = 50 (correct)
 Small batch (5 symbols)  1 batch
 Medium batch (50 symbols)  1 batch
 Large batch (100 symbols)  2 batches
 Delay between batches working (~500ms)

STATUS: ALL TESTS PASSED
